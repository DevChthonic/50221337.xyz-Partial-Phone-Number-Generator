## The Origin Story

This project was born from a simple challenge. A friend, let's call her "Elena," gave me her phone number but left three digits blank and told me to "guess."

As a developer, my mind immediately jumped to the programmatic solution rather than simple guesswork. How many combinations were there? (1,000). Could I generate them all? (Yes). This led me down a rabbit hole where I explored not just combination generation, but also the technologies behind automated calling (Twilio), voice biometrics (Veridas), and the legalities of wiretapping in Canada (don't do it).

In the end, I decided against the wildly illegal surveillance scheme and instead built this toolâ€”a safe, fun, and useful way for anyone to solve a similar puzzle without risking a five-year prison sentence.

## Features

* **Safe & Secure:** This app has zero backend, no database, and logs absolutely nothing. Your search is your business.
* **Responsive Design:** Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices.
